- Loperamide16Samplicon_analysis.Rmd, and knitted outputs

## [output/](output/)
QIIME2 artifacts and processed files  
- *core-metrics-results*: diversity metrics calculated by QIIME2
- *exported*: files exported from QIIME2, then imported to excel
- *rarefaction*: curves generated by QIIME2
- *taxonomy*: annotations and barplots generated by QIIME2
- all other qza and qzv files generated during the QIIME2 pipeline

## [figures/](figures/)
Output from Rmd file in scripts/  

## [metadata/](metadata/)

- **sample-manifest.csv** - file to import raw sequence files into QIIME2 .qza format using `qiime tools import`
